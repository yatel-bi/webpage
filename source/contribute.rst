How to Contribute
-----------------

Open Source delivers better products faster because of the strength of an active
community - developers, testers, writers, implementers, and most of all users.
No matter which 'er' you happen to be or what phase of implementation or
evaluation you are in, you can make valuable contributions.

Here's your guide to submitting just about any contribution to the Yatel
project. If you don't find the answers you need here, please post your question
to our `forums <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/utn_kdd>`_.


Discussion Forum and Issues - Our Links to the Community
--------------------------------------------------------

As you read on, you'll discover there are two primary ways of making sure your
contributions are reviewed in a timely fashion and recognized - through our
Discussion Forum and by way of our issue and bug tracking system, Bitbucket.

The Discussion Forum are the first line of communication, collaboration and
support for the Yatel community. Not only can you get direct responses from the
Yatel development team, but the rest of the community is there to provide
additional input and feedback regarding your ideas for the platform. We do
not suggest you report bugs or send contributions through the forums however,
because they will tend to get lost amongst the many conversation threads
that take place there.

All bug reports, code, and solution contributions are recorded and tracked
through our Bitbucket issue and bug tracking system. You can find our
Issues system :ref:`here <issues>`.
Bitbucket provides the Yatel community with access to valuable information
like the status of a particular bug fix, prioritization of new features and
enhancements, a long term roadmap for the platform and a place for the
community to log issues and contributions.


Reporting a Bug
---------------

All bug reports are recorded and tracked through our issue and bug tracking
system. You can find our issue  system :ref:`here <issues>`.

Before submitting a bug report to the issues system, be sure to search existing
issues cases and our discussion forums for similar accounts of the behavior
you are seeing. There's a good possibility that the bug may already be reported,
in which case you can get a status update on when a fix may be available and
possibly a work around for the time being. There's also a chance that the
behavior is expected by design and you can get further clarification on how
the product is designed to work.  Please do a thorough search of Issues
before submitting new issues. In many cases you may be seeing a different
symptom of a known bug. Having duplicate Issue cases wastes time and resources
that could be spent on design and coding. If you find that your bug has already
been reported, you can vote for it to be moved higher in the priority list.

If, after serious digging, you don't find any record of the bug, then log the
case in our issues system. You can browse all cases in all projects in issues,
and should take the time to consider which project is the appropriate place for
your case. You must be a registered user in order to log the problem.
The registration process is quick and painless, and only needs to be done once.

After you have logged in to Bitbucket, there are a few guidelines you should
follow to get the best response to your case:

- Make sure you set the *kind* type properly - for a bug, the type should be... well... "Bug".
- The 'title' field in the case report is the first thing Yatel
  developers see when reviewing submitted cases, so make that description
  short but precise.
- When filling in the 'description' field of the case report, the more detail
  for a reproduction of the bug you can give us, the better chance we have of
  finding and fixing said bug. Include details such as what exactly went wrong,
  the steps you took to reproduce the error, and what you expected to happen.
- Select the priority with caution.


Contributing Code
-----------------

Of course, the best ideas and bug notifications come with that last note
saying, "By the way, I already wrote the code - where would you like me to
send it?" We rely on our community contributions of time and code (and
we'll never turn down money or wiskey) to keep our commitment to deliver a
quality business intelligence platform in the open source arena.

If you wish to contribute to Yatel (which you're very welcome and encouraged
to do so) then you must agree to release the rights of your source to us under
this license.


Bitbucket hosted projects and submitting code
---------------------------------------------

Bitbucket comes with it's own built-in process for contributing to projects.
Please follow the documentation out on BitBucket to submit a "pull request"
back to Yatel `Bitbucket Pull Request Doc. <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Work+with+pull+requests>`_.
Please include a link to your pull request in the issue case instead of patch files or pasted code.


Contributing Documentation
--------------------------

We value any community member that's willing to help improve or add to our
technical documentation as much as we value our code development community.
Probably more, since we are not the best technical writers ourselves and suffer
mind-numbing pain through each documentation exercise.

If you would like to contribute an improvement to our documentation, or submit
a technical article, you can do so in the doc folder of :ref:`Yatel Repo <code>`.
