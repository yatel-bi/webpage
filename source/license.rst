The WISKEY-WARE License
-----------------------

The license under which the Yatel software is released is the WISKEY-WARE
(a funny version of `BSD-Like <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses>`_).
A copy of the license is included with every copy of Yatel, but you can also
read the text of the license `here <_static/LICENSE.txt>`_.


WISKEY-WARE is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek term for software released under a
very relaxed license. It provides the end user with the right to use a
particular program (or do anything else with the source code).  is an almost
word-for-word copy of the `Beerware licence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware>`_,
and true to its spirit.
